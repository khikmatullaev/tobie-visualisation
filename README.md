Yii 2 Application 
TOBIE PROJECT VISUALISATION
============================
At present, it has to admit that the employment situations
are becoming more and more serious. Therefore, it requires the data
visualizations to provide the comprehensive information for job seekers.
At the same time, the Internet is playing an increasingly important role
in everyone's daily life. So it comes that the online information about job
demand is available massively, and it will be convenient for job seekers
online.
We focus on visualization technique to visualize the sophisticated data.
Our project involves building a Trend Analysis Ontology-based Infor-
mation Extraction (TOBIE) System, discovering how to use the TOBIE
system as raw data for nding changes and detecting trends on the skills
to trend analysis of skills. The TOBIE system is committed to creating
interactive graphs which contain all information and visualizing trend
results on web-based user interactive interface. The contribution of our
project improves employment problem by visualizing result more intu-
itively for users.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.3.1"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.
